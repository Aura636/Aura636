Hey there, I'm Aura!

I'm a Systems Technican, Programmer, I study Information Security and I'm a hobbist level designer.
I'm looking to motivate myself to work on code more often as making software tends to be pretty fun, but I have many callings.
I think it's a shame that the activity tracker doesn't publiclly log private repositories. I'm doing work, but it's just not meant for public eyes..
